# Deep learning on PPG data

## This repository contains a file with:
1. analysis of PPG data
2. building and training a CNN on PPG data
3. evaluating the CNN on PPG data

The data analysed contains raw PPG signal obtained from 24 subjects in 5 different conditions.

## This repository contains images of:
1. Average heart-rate of each subject per condition/activity.
2. A plot of model accuracy and loss on both test and validation data for each epoch during training.
3. A confusion matrix for the final model.

## Requirements
Python (version 3.12.1) with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- keras
- matplotlib
- seaborn
